# Solving Programming Problems from Various Books

This repository is a collection of solutions to programming problems sourced from a variety of books. The goal is to build problem-solving skills, explore different approaches, and deepen the understanding of computer science concepts. ***Yeah, as if.***

## About the Repository

The repository is organized by book and problem type. Each directory corresponds to a specific book, and within each directory, the problems are categorized either by chapters or topics, allowing for easy navigation and study. ***Not yet, though.***

## Books Covered

This project currently includes problems from the following books (more books will be added in the future):

- *Book 1 Title*: ***Which I'll tell later...***

## Benefits

- **Diverse challenges**: By solving problems from various books, this repository provides a wide range of problems that span across basic and intermediate topics, offering challenges suitable for various levels of expertise.
- **Improving coding skills**: Regular practice of coding problems is essential to improving speed and efficiency in problem-solving.
- **Learning new techniques**: Each book introduces unique approaches and methods to solving problems, broadening your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms... ***P-probably?***

## Repository Structure

- **Book Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a specific book. The problems within each folder are organized based on chapters or topics.
- **Problem Files**: Each problem is solved in its own file, with solutions clearly written and organized. ***Explanations will be provided later... if you want to...***

## Contributing
